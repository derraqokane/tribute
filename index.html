    <h3 id="headline">syphony and rap:</h3>
  Samuel-Ulrich Boni, also known as Alias, expresses his frustrations and fears in his song "Respire Floyd", where he embodies the late George Floyd. He believes that one should not reveal anything about the future to someone who has lost a loved one, as it only adds to their fear and anxiety. The young rapper from Ivory Coast is known for his empathy, and in this project, he is accompanied by a real string quartet that adapts to his rhythm. The fusion of street language and concert hall music creates a unique and emotionally charged experience. The five Musikaa video portraits, available on the KlaraFestival website, showcase the talents of local artists and can be accessed via a simple QR scan. The project was made possible through a partnership between KlaraFestival, Bozar, the commune of Molenbeek, and five organizations supporting local talent. The collaboration between Alias, other artists, and the string quartet required everyone to step out of their comfort zone and improvise to create a powerful performance
